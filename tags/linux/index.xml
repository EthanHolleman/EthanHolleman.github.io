      <description>I use Ubuntu 20.04 as my daily driver operating system at work and at home. When I am on campus I had a really hard time consistently connecting to the campus eduroam network on my Linux machine; usually resorting to guest wifi (disgusting).
The Davis IT knowledge hub suggests you run a Eduroam provided Python script configuration program. This worked on one of my machines and failed on another. Additionally, it may require storing your password in plain text.
I had much better luck following this guide from the physics department. However it is outdated and there is one key change you must make for the instructions in this guide to work.</description>
