      <description>Background I recently saw the an article titled Non-invasive early detection of cancer four years before conventional diagnosis using a blood test . This is obviously an impressive claim and so I skimmed through. The methods of the test are very interesting; the authors measured methylation of DNA in blood plasma and then used logistic regression to classify reads as cancerous or not cancerous in origin based on DNA-methylation patterns extracted from the cancer genome atlas.
The paper claims to detect 88% of 5 common cancer types in post-diagnosis patients with a specificity of 96%. Another way of saying the same thing is that their test has a false-negative rate of 12% and a false-positive rate of 4%.</description>
